# @all-turtles/components

A React component library for All Turtles software.

🦁 [View Source on GitHub](https://github.com/All-Turtles/components)

## Setup

This package is hosted via the GitHub Package Registry. For usage in your projects, add this line to `.npmrc`:

```@all-turtles:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/```

This will tell npm which registry to look in when installing the package.

## Authentication

- This is a private package meaning both you and your deployment server must have appropriate access rights.
- For local installation, your GitHub user must have access to this repository. If you're reading this, that step is complete.
- For deployment servers, use a Personal Access Token. [Read the official GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
  - Add a command similar to this to your deployment steps

    ```echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" >> ~/.npmrc```

## Installation

```npm install --save @all-turtles/components```

## Usage

```
import { Logo } from @all-turtles/components

<Logo />

```

## Styling

By design, there is very little styling out of the box. Most components come with a prefixed class name that can be overridden via props.

## Running locally

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Publishing

- Create a GitHub personal access token for the command line.
